Visualizing ChromHMM

Collaboration with https://github.com/jcrada

*** TODOs

- Add parameter plots to label/coverage plot.
- Add iteration parameter? Is is possible to obtain predictions at
  every genomic position for every iteration?

- added coverage data plot for one/several genomic regions.
- added selector for number of states.
- It is clear that the high false positive rate is due to 
  using the bad default macs peaks as input to ChromHMM.
